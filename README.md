### The Embedded App SDK enables you to build rich, multiplayer experiences inside Discord.

Activities are multiplayer games and social experiences in Discord. An Activity is a web application hosted in an iframe that can run within the Discord client on desktop, web, or mobile. The Embedded App SDK handles the communication between Discord and your iframed application.

Read more about building Discord Activities with the Embedded App SDK on [https://activities-preview.pages.dev/developers/docs/activities/overview](https://discord.com/developers/docs/activities/overview).

## Installing this package

TODO - remove `github:` prefix once public npm package is available

```shell
npm install github:@discord/embedded-app-sdk
```

## Usage

To use the SDK, import it into your project and construct a new instance of the DiscordSDK class.

Below is a minimal example of setting up the SDK.
Visit [/examples/discord-activity-starter](/examples/discord-activity-starter/README.md) for a complete example application. See more info on environment variables (`YOUR_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID`, etc...) [here](https://activities-preview.pages.dev/developers/docs/activities/building-an-activity#find-your-oauth2-credentials).

```typescript
import {DiscordSDK} from '@discord/embedded-app-sdk';
const discordSdk = new DiscordSDK(YOUR_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID);

async function setup() {
  // Wait for READY payload from the discord client
  await discordSdk.ready();

  // Pop open the OAuth permission modal and request for access to scopes listed in scope array below
  const {code} = await discordSdk.commands.authorize({
    client_id: YOUR_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID,
    response_type: 'code',
    state: '',
    prompt: 'none',
    scope: ['identify'],
  });

  // Retrieve an access_token from your application's server
  const response = await fetch('/api/token', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      code,
    }),
  });
  const {access_token} = await response.json();

  // Authenticate with Discord client (using the access_token)
  auth = await discordSdk.commands.authenticate({
    access_token,
  });
}
```
