# React Colyseus Example

![Screenshot of the react colyseus example running](/assets/example-application.gif)

This repo is an example built on top of two javascript frameworks

1. [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) - A frontend javascript UI framework
2. [Colyseus](https://www.colyseus.io/) - A full-stack state-management library

## Client architecture

The client (aka front-end) is using [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev/)'s React Typescript starter project. Vite has great starter projects in [many common javascript frameworks](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#trying-vite-online). All of these projects use the same config setup, which means that if you prefer VanillaJS, Svelte, etc... you can swap frameworks and still get the following:

- Fast typescript bundling with hot-module-reloading
- Identical configuration API
- Identical environment variable API

## Server architecture

The server (aka back-end) is using Express with typescript. Any file in the server project can be imported by the client, in case you need to share business logic.

## Colyseus

We're going to manage and synchronize our embedded app's state via [Colyseus](https://www.colyseus.io/). Our server is stateful and will hold the source of truth for our embedded app, and each client will post messages to the server to modify this state. ⚠️ This example is not (yet) architected to scale to production. It is meant for rapid prototyping and to showcase common SDK and API patterns.

## Setting up your Discord Application

Before we write any code, lets follow the instructions [here](https://activities-preview.pages.dev/developers/docs/activities/building-an-activity#step-1-creating-a-new-app) to make sure your Discord application is set up correctly.

## Setting up your environment variables

In order to run your app, you will need to create a `.env` file. Rename the file [/examples/react-colyseus/example.env](/examples/react-colyseus/example.env) to `.env` and fill it in with the appropriate OAuth2 variables. The OAuth2 variables can be found in the OAuth2 tab on the developer portal, as described [here](https://activities-preview.pages.dev/developers/docs/activities/building-an-activity#find-your-oauth2-credentials)

```.env
# Example .env file
# Rename this from example.env to .env
VITE_CLIENT_ID=PASTE_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID_HERE
CLIENT_SECRET=PASTE_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE
```

## Running your app locally

As described [here](https://activities-preview.pages.dev/developers/docs/activities/building-an-activity#step-4-running-your-app-locally-in-discord), we encourage using a tunnel solution such as [cloudflared](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared#installing-cloudflared) for local development.
To run your app locally, run the following from this directory (/examples/react-colyseus)

```
pnpm install # only need to run this the first time
pnpm dev
pnpm tunnel # from another terminal
```

Be sure to complete all the steps listed [here](https://activities-preview.pages.dev/developers/docs/activities/building-an-activity) to ensure your development setup is working as expected.

## Where do you go from here?

This basic example will render users' avatars and show a green circle around anyone who is talking. It will spin up one "room" per Discord voice channel. It's a great starting point for your app, whether you're planning to stay in "react-land" or planning to use Unity / Cocos / etc...

## Common patterns with Colyseus

### Expanding state

Let's say you wanted to add position (x, y) to each player, and allow them to move. This requires changes across the front-end and back-end. Here's an example of how to do that:

- Extend `Player.ts`' schema to include x and y as numbers

+    this.y = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000);
   }
 }
```

- Add a keyboard event listener which will send "move" commands to the server when arrow keys are pressed

+      document.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
+    };
+  }, [room]);

   return (
     <div className="voice__channel__container">
```

- Create an event listener on `StateHandlerRoom.ts` to handle "move" events coming from clients

```diff

+++ b/examples/react-colyseus/packages/server/src/rooms/StateHandlerRoom.ts

+      this.state.movePlayer(client.sessionId, data);
+    });
   }

   onAuth(_client: any, _options: any, _req: any) {
```

- Create a command to allow moving a player in `State.ts`

- Update the UI to consume the stateful updates to each player

 }
```

### Adding a new environment variable

In order to add new environment variables, you will need to do the following:

1. Add the environment key and value to `.env`
2. Add the key to [/examples/react-colyseus/packages/client/src/vite-env.d.ts](/examples/react-colyseus/packages/client/src/vite-env.d.ts)
3. Add the key to [/examples/react-colyseus/packages/server/environment.d.ts](/examples/react-colyseus/packages/server/environment.d.ts)

This will ensure that you have type safety in your client and server code when consuming environment variables

Per the [ViteJS docs](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html#env-files)

> To prevent accidentally leaking env variables to the client, only variables prefixed with VITE\_ are exposed to your Vite-processed code.

```env
# Example .env file
VITE_CLIENT_ID=123456789012345678
CLIENT_SECRET=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdef
```
