### [Discord Activity Starter](/examples/discord-activity-starter)

This starter app will get you up and running quickly with the basic skeleton of an Embedded App using Node.js, React, and Vite.

### [SDK Playground](/examples/sdk-playground)

This example implements the SDK commands and events available within the application's iframe while building your app.

### [React Colysesus](/examples/react-colyseus)

This example uses Node.js, React, and [Colyseus](https://colyseus.io/), a multiplayer JS framework, to demonstrate state management in a multiplayer experience.

### [Nested Messages](/examples/nested-messages)

This example implements an Embedded App using a nested framework like a game engine. When using a game engine, you need to send messages between a parent iframe and the nested framework.
