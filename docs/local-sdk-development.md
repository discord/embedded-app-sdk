# Local SDK development

When developing the SDK locally, you can enable the SDK to rebuild "on save" by running `npm run dev`.

We recommend testing changes to the SDK against the SDK-Playground example, which can be found [here](https://github.com/discord/embedded-app-sdk-examples/tree/main/sdk-playground#testing-sdk-changes-locally).

## JSON Schema updates

If you need to update any generated JSON schema values, follow the guide [here](/docs/schema-gen.md).
