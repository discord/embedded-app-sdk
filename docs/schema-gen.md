Some of the RPC commands and Typescript Types are constructed via a JSON schema which is generated by Discord. To update the JSON schema, please do the following:

- From Discord, make sure you have run `clyde gen rpc`
- From the root of this github repo, run the following
  ```
  npm run sync -- --path path/to/monorepo/discord_common/js/packages/rpc-schema/generated/schema.json
  ```
- Commit your changes and update as needed
